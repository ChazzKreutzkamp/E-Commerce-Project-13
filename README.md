# E-Commerce Back End API

## Description

This code is the backend to a potential E-Commerce website with models for categories, products, and tags. The API routes have been designed to get data for the respective models, create new data via post methods, update data via put methods, and delete data via deletion methods. This code also has schema and seed files to help get you started with creating a database on your own computer via mysql. This code doesn't have a front-end designed for it so all your testing of it will need to be done via programs like insomnia. (To see the code in action please look at the video below.)
